# Academic Pages – Content Pack (Wei Tu)

This pack contains starter content for your GitHub Pages site. To use:

1. Ensure your repo is named `we**i**tumuch.github.io` (or your future username `.github.io`) and Pages is set to "Deploy from a branch" (main/master).
2. Upload the files/folders in this ZIP into the root of your repo:
   - `_config.yml`
   - `_pages/about.md`
   - `_pages/cv.md`
   - `_publications/*`
   - `index.md`
   - Put your PDF CV at: `assets/Wei_TU_CV_2024Sep.pdf` (create the `assets` folder if it doesn't exist).
3. Commit changes; wait 1–2 minutes; visit your site URL.

You can customize the nav by editing `_config.yml` and add more publications by adding markdown files under `_publications/`.
