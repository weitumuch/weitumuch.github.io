My group develops and applies statistical methods to improve the **design, analysis, and interpretability** of cancer clinical trials, and integrates multimodal biomarkers to inform precision oncology.

## Research directions
- **Clinical Trial Methodology**  
  Statistical methods for trial design and analysis, with interests in survival, informative censoring, patient-reported outcomes, and methods to improve efficiency and interpretability of results.  

- **Biomarkers & Precision Oncology**  
  Integration of genomic, imaging, and liquid biopsy data to develop prognostic and predictive models that inform treatment selection.  

- **Statistical Learning for Health Data**  
  Approaches for analyzing high-dimensional and complex datasets, including machine learning and data harmonization across trials.  

- **Data Integration & Real-World Evidence**  
  Combining clinical trial data with administrative health databases, electronic health records, and real-world cohorts to broaden impact and applicability of findings.
